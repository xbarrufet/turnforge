## Position Requiremtns
Right now we have two types of Positions
- Vector
- TileID
We want to add a new type of Position, Conneciton that Connects two tiles, this allows us to create elements that live between tiles, like doors, windows, etc.

Position should also expose witch type of Position it is, Vector, TileID or Connection
